Tate's pseudocode:

Vincent's pseudocode:
    Provide a tkinter window for menu choices, if they click a button, it should send them to that respective function.
    Once inside the function, there should be a menu for the function that displays everything. 
    Some functions use a user selection, I need to have a list of all the users and if they are selected, it needs to return the information.
    Every menu should have scroll, and if it's showing data, it should replace whatever is already there
    Use tkinter to make a window to show the information in charts.
